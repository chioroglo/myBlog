It is comprised of five contiguous states located in southern California,[4][5] with additional territorial holdings in northern California,[6][7] Oregon[8] and Nevada.[9][10]  Considering itself an inheritor to pre-war values of democracy, personal liberty and rule of law, the NCR has developed a highly expansionist culture, undertaking colonization efforts and military expeditions into neighboring regions in order to \"civilize\" them.[11] However these policies are not without controversy, and by 2281 many within and outside the Republic have come to criticize it as hawkish and prone to corruption.  The New California Republic is mentioned in the endings for Fallout, and grows to become a major faction in two subsequent games focusing on geopolitical struggles: In Fallout 2 it faces New Reno and Vault City in the competition for control over the northern half of California, while in Fallout: New Vegas it faces the Caesar's Legion in a titanic struggle for control over the Mojave and the future of the American Southwest which, according to some, can be described as the single greatest geopolitical conflict since the Great War.[12][13]",

To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse.[2][3]  As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado.[4] Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire.[5"

However, Carla was recently kidnapped by Caesar's Legion while he was on guard and he suspects foul play. When the Courier first meets him, Boone is bitterly whiling away the hours until he can find out and kill whoever is responsible for the disappearance of his wife; waiting for the perfect stranger to arrive and to hopefully help find who facilitated the taking of his wife.[1] Hardened and psychologically troubled from his time in the NCR military, Boone vacillates between being a stone-cold killer and a decent human being. Venturing out from the relative safety of Novac brings Boone into close contact with his old life until he is forced to deal with the tragic events that caused him to leave the military."
